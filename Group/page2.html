<h2>About the DayCare</h2>
<p><h3>history of our day care</h3><strong>MAEMBE daycare was established in 1997 at Morogoro region. our daycare started with 30 kids from different area of morogoro region. as the time goes on our day care received a large number of kids. up now we have almost 2000 kids at our daycare centre.In attempting to paint a picture of global developments in early childhood education and care policies and programs, we are confronted by the paucity of national data, let alone comparative, cross-national data.  Reviewing the histories of ECEC developments in several countries reminds us that in much of Europe and North America, and even in several of the developing countries such as China and India, kindergartens and nurseries were first established in the 19th century, often drawing on the same models:  Froebel, Pestalozzi, Montessori, and the activities of missionaries.  Early on, a distinction was made between “kindergartens” for educational purposes and day nurseries to provide care.</p></strong>

<p><h3>Aims and goals of our daycare</h3><strong>Early childhood education and care are services for children under compulsory school age involving elements of both physical care and education.1  Apart from their critical contribution to cognitive stimulation, socialization, child development, and early education, they are an essential service for employed parents.  Before and after school programs may also be provided for primary-school--aged children.  (The data concerning these programs are far less available, however.)  ECEC programs include a wide range of part-day, full-school-day, and full-work-day programs under education, health, and social welfare auspices, funded and delivered in a variety of ways in both the public and private sectors.2  ECEC programs may be publicly funded and delivered (the predominant pattern in the Nordic countries, for example) publicly funded and privately delivered (as in the Netherlands and Germany, for example), or include a combination of publicly-funded and delivered, publicly-funded and privately delivered, and privately funded and delivered programs as in many of the less developed countries such as Brazil as well as most of Africa, for example.  They may be free, in particular those programs delivered under education auspices, or they may charge income-related fees; but in almost all of Europe they are heavily subsidized by government. </strong>

<p><h3>Achivements </h3>Children learn structure and routine at a young age and are responsible for putting away their coats, putting on their shoes and other independent tasks. </p>
